Task 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations. The goal is to analyze monthly revenue (using SUM(amount)) and order volume (using COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) from the online_sales dataset. The SQL script will EXTRACT year/month from order_date, GROUP BY these, and ORDER BY for clarity. This project teaches data grouping and time trend analysis.
